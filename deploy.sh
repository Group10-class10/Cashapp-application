#Application for Class10 deployment
this is a great project
hopefully it will be followed by a Readme file
readme file is often the first file which users read. 
it could be a text file that contains key info for users about the software, project, code, & game etc 
sometmes, it might contain instructions, help, or details about patches or updates.
